# Post-Quantum Cryptography Demo - Presentation Guide

## üéØ **What This Application Does**

This is a **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) demonstration application** that shows how quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms work on resource-constrained devices (like IoT devices). It's designed to help people understand the future of cryptography in a post-quantum world.

## üîë **Key Concepts You Need to Understand**

### **1. What is Post-Quantum Cryptography?**
- **Traditional cryptography** (like RSA, ECC) can be broken by quantum computers
- **Post-quantum cryptography** uses mathematical problems that even quantum computers can't solve efficiently
- **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is currently standardizing PQC algorithms
- This application demonstrates two of the most promising PQC algorithms

### **2. Why is PQC Important?**
- **Quantum computers** are becoming more powerful
- **Current encryption** (used in banking, government, internet) will become vulnerable
- **PQC provides** a secure alternative that works with both classical and quantum computers
- **IoT devices** need lightweight, secure cryptography

## üîê **The Two PQC Algorithms Demonstrated**

### **1. CRYSTALS-Kyber (Key Encapsulation)**
- **Purpose**: Secure key exchange between two parties
- **How it works**:
  - Alice generates a public/private key pair
  - Bob uses Alice's public key to create a shared secret
  - Only Alice can recover the shared secret using her private key
- **Real-world use**: Secure communication, VPNs, encrypted messaging

**Step-by-step process**:
1. **Generate Keypair**: Creates public key (~800 bytes) and private key (~1632 bytes)
2. **Encapsulate**: Bob creates a shared secret and ciphertext using Alice's public key
3. **Decapsulate**: Alice recovers the shared secret using her private key

### **2. CRYSTALS-Dilithium (Digital Signatures)**
- **Purpose**: Prove authenticity and integrity of messages
- **How it works**:
  - Alice signs a message with her private key
  - Bob verifies the signature using Alice's public key
  - If valid, Bob knows the message came from Alice and wasn't tampered with
- **Real-world use**: Software updates, legal documents, authentication

**Step-by-step process**:
1. **Generate Keypair**: Creates signing key (~4000 bytes) and verification key (~1952 bytes)
2. **Sign**: Alice creates a digital signature (~2701 bytes) for a message
3. **Verify**: Bob checks if the signature is valid using Alice's public key

## üîç **Common Questions & Answers**

### **Q: What makes this different from regular cryptography?**
**A**: Regular cryptography (RSA, ECC) can be broken by quantum computers using Shor's algorithm. PQC algorithms use mathematical problems that are hard for both classical and quantum computers.

### **Q: Why are the keys so large?**
**A**: PQC algorithms need larger keys to achieve the same security level as traditional cryptography. This is because they're based on different mathematical problems (lattice-based cryptography).

### **Q: Is this production-ready?**
**A**: No, this is a demonstration application for educational purposes. The cryptographic operations are real, but keys are stored in plain text and the interface is designed for learning, not security.

### **Q: How do you know it's secure?**
**A**: The algorithms (Kyber and Dilithium) have been extensively analyzed by the cryptographic community and are finalists in NIST's PQC standardization process. They're based on well-studied mathematical problems.

### **Q: What happens if quantum computers become powerful?**
**A**: Traditional cryptography will become vulnerable, but PQC algorithms will remain secure. This application shows how to implement quantum-resistant cryptography.

### **Q: Why simulate IoT constraints?**
**A**: Real IoT devices have limited memory and processing power. This simulation helps developers understand the performance characteristics of PQC algorithms on resource-constrained devices.

### **Q: How does the performance compare to traditional cryptography?**
**A**: PQC algorithms are generally slower and use more memory than traditional ones, but they provide quantum resistance. The performance metrics in the app show these trade-offs.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Questions & Answers**

### **Q: How does the web interface work?**
**A**: The interface uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend and Flask (Python) for the backend. It makes AJAX calls to API endpoints that perform cryptographic operations.

### **Q: What database is used?**
**A**: SQLite database (`pqc_demo.db`) stores all operations, performance metrics, and resource usage data. It's lightweight and perfect for demonstrations.

### **Q: How is resource monitoring implemented?**
**A**: Uses the `psutil` Python library to monitor system resources in real-time. The `ResourceMonitor` class enforces memory and CPU limits.

### **Q: What happens if an operation fails?**
**A**: The application catches exceptions and returns user-friendly error messages. All errors are logged and displayed to the user.

### **Q: How is the interface responsive?**
**A**: Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, with media queries for mobile devices. The design automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.
